# Note: This is a fallback configuration
# Each application should be deployed separately using their specific netlify.toml files:
# - apps/web/netlify.toml (Marketing Site)
# - apps/remix/netlify.toml (Remix App)  
# - apps/docs/netlify.toml (Documentation)
#
# Or use the root configuration files:
# - netlify-marketing.toml (for marketing site)
# - netlify-docs.toml (for docs site)
